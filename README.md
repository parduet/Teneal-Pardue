### About me

I'm originally from Asheville, NC and now call Charlotte home.  I've earned Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction: Urban Mathematics Education, all specializing in statistics. Professional interests are statistics education, data analytics, and using statistics to promote social justice.  Since 2004, I've been on the faculty at Queens University of Charlotte, currently as an Assistant Professor. Previous jobs have been modeling analyst in banking, and teaching high school.

I'm married and have four (yes, four) cats.  Personal interests include Broadway musicals, mystery novels, and travel to scenic places.
